Creating a simple JavaScript Canvas game

I don't have any experience with making canvas based games, so this branch will be absolutely chaotic and probably highly inefficent codewise
I'm still learning, but i will try to make a fun little game.

Goal:

* The player controls a ship with mouse and keyboard.
* different enemies approach from outside the canvas and try to destroy the player.
* Wave-based, with more and harder enemies each wave.
* Every 10th wave appears a boss.
* Upgrade ship between waves for better fighting ability.
* Local saves are possible.
* Black and white color scheme. (Like Gato Roboto, Minit and the like)
